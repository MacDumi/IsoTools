# IsoTools

This program can calculate the isotopic distribution of chemical species.
It can also calculate and plot the resulting isotopic pattern of a complex chemical mixture containing multiple compounds in different proportions.
This feature can be used while interpreting mass spectrometric data.

# Instructions

To plot the isotopic distribution of a molecule/atom introduce it's chemical formula and press the **Add** button. 
You can also change the heigh of the resulting spectrum (default value is 100). 
The plot can be cleared by pressing the **Clear** button.

Example Chemical formulas:

    C
    Al2O3
    PbCl2
    C60

You can add as many chemical species as you want, while also changing the height property for each one, effectively changing the amount of each compound in the mixture. 
The Cumulative line on the plot shows the isotopic distribution of the resulting mixture. 
Any compound can be removed from the mixture by first selecting it in the list of displayed species and then pressing the **Remove selected** button.

The obtained isotopic distribution can be exported as either an image or a text file.
